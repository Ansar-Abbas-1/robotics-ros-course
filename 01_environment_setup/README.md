# Week 1 – Environment Setup for Robotics using Google Colab

## Objective
The goal of this week is to establish a Linux-based development environment
suitable for robotics and ROS development using Google Colab, without requiring
a local Ubuntu installation.

## Tools Used
- Google Colab (Ubuntu backend)
- GNU Compiler Collection (G++)
- Git & GitHub
- CMake (installed for future use)

## Activities Performed
- Verified Linux system configuration
- Installed essential development tools
- Compiled and executed a C++ program
- Created a structured robotics workspace

## Motivation
This setup allows full ROS and robotics development in a cloud-based environment,
making it suitable for students without native Linux installations.

## Next Steps
- Install ROS Noetic
- Create first ROS nodes (publisher/subscriber)
